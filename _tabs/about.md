## Hi there! I'm Doug.

Designer, programmer, builder, fixer, maker. I am a computer scientist who loves innovation. In my free time I like to tinker with electronics, play guitar, sing and travel.

This is a place to put my thoughts and document projects that I think people might find interesting.

Having been an avid tinkerer my whole life, I have focussed on how to solve problems without much thought put into communicating the problems and/or solutions. Throughout my career as a Software Engineer, I've observed that those who possess the ability to effectively communicate, those who can tell a captivating story, are the people who are generally considered to be "good" engineers.

Improving my writing increases my ability to convey ideas. Improving writing requires practice. This is the motivation behind creating this site.
