## Wise

Wise (formerly TransferWise) is a financial technology company. Their main service is low-fee international money transfers.
Though, they have extended their offering to allow users to open local accounts in multiple countries. They also offer a debit card that seamlessly converts money between currencies depending on where you use it. I personally use the Wise card for travelling.
